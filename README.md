# Learning-Python

In this repository, you will find applications I have created when learning how to code in Python. These applications have resulted 
in an improvment in my coding abilities. The IDE I tend to frequently use is Google Colab which is a Cloud Computing IDE. The nice thing
about using this IDE is that I don't have to always save my files locally and am able to upload the scripts straight onto a repo.
